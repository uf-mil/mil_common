This is the beggining of the mil_msgs ros package. This is still in the process of being adapted from the legacy uf-common package. Be sure to update old references to uf_common if you find them around our repos.

This package should contain any .msg, .srv, or .action files that are platform agnostic and have potential to be used by multiiple robots.

Note:
The 'msg_helpers' and 'param_helpers' headers are a better fit for the mil_dev_tools package but I (David Soto) will not be transitioning them at the moment. (Feel free to do so!)
