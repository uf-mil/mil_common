# This script will be sourced by the MIL runcom file if the install script
# cloned this repository during a run or if the install script was run after
# it was cloned manually. It contains general MIL commands that have been
# aliased to make them faster or easier to execute. Becoming familiar with
# these will likely increase productivity, so it is recommended to do so.
